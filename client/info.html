                <p> 
                    This Four-player chess is a variation of original classical chess that involves four players, each controlling their own set of pieces. In this game, players must not only focus on their opponents directly in front of them, but also keep an eye on the actions of their two other opponents, adding a complex layer of strategy and tactics to the game. With four players, the game is more dynamic and fast-paced players constantly adapt to changing situations and think several moves ahead.¬†The rules and regulations are exactly the same as the traditional 2-player chess for example, castling, pawn promotion at 8th rank, and piece moves, checkmate and stalemate positions, the pieces all being the same (pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, kings) etc.¬†
                    
                    This game will have a change of chess board layout to adjust to 4 player variation. The main middle 64 squares(8 rows and 8 files) will be the same but each side will have it's own additional 3 rows on their side with 2 rows containing their pieces and 1 row blank.

The four-faced die was rolled to determine which piece was to play.That leads us to say that not only 4-player chess but also chess itself originated from India.</p>

                        Organised chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (the International Chess Federation). Commonly referred to by its French acronym FIDE (/ÀàfiÀêde…™/ FEE-day F√©d√©ration Internationale des √âchecs) From the Early 18th century, Many presented their versions of Four handed chess such as George Hope Verney in 1881, M. E. Hughes-Hughes in 1888, K.E.G., Dessau in 1784 were one of the most accepted and played versions of four handed chess. The biggest and most well known club of the variations was the Four-handed Chess Club, founded by George Hope Lloyd Verney. It began in 1884, in London. As none of the variations of four handed¬† chess.<br><br>The rules of chess as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardisation and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people. The game enjoyed a considerable following until the end of the 19th century (the White collection club has a score book of it) after which support slowly declined. According to David B. Pritchard, Four-player chess "is generally understood to be a game played with two sets on a standard board with four extensions, one on each side, usually of 8x3 squares (arguably the best arrangement) but sometimes 8x2 or 8x4, on which the pieces are set up in the normal array positions.<p>

                    Four-Handed Chess is loosely any variant for four players. More specifically, it is generally understood to be a partnership game played with two sets on a standard board with four extensions, one on each side, usually of 8x3 squares (arguably the best arrangement) but sometimes 8x2 or 8x4, on which the pieces are set up in the normal array positions. The four-handed game dates from the 18th century and enjoyed considerable popularity,particularly in Germany but also in England - The Philidorian reported (1838) ‚ÄòThe game of chess for four is advancing daily in fashion and favor with the British Public‚Äô. The year before it had been described as coming from Germany, ‚Äòthe only country where it is practised‚Äô.</p>

                    During the half-century 1825-1875, numerous booklets appeared, mostly in the U.K. but also in Europe and America, giving basic rules for four-player chess. Almost all of these, some little more than pamphlets, carried only the name of the publisher. The game was dismissed as ‚Äòa kind of whist‚Äô (Le Palam√®de). Another theory has the game originating in Russia.
